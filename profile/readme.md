<h2>About Eclipse Community</h2>
<p>Eclipse Community was created to be an alternative to other boards like MSFN, MDL, Vista/7 forums, and more.

The main goals are to freely offer information to people with or without an account, have a nice community with good moderators, be full of useful information, be accessible from many devices, and more.

Eclipse Community has since evolved into much more, a community developing software to keep the dream of a good computing experience alive!

If you have any friends that may be interested in our board or software, we would really appreciate it if you showed it to them.</p>
